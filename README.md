# Faculty Teaching Tracker

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Educational institutions lack a centralized digital system for faculty to manage teaching sections, track syllabus completion, and monitor day-wise teaching progress. Existing manual or semi-digital methods are inefficient, fragmented, and fail to provide real-time visibility into teaching progress.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
Faculty Teaching Tracker is a web-based dashboard that allows faculty members to securely log in, manage teaching sections, track syllabus coverage topic-wise, and view overall teaching progress in real time. The platform replaces manual tracking with a structured, digital, and intuitive system.

## ❓ How is this different from existing solutions?
- Most existing systems are **manual, spreadsheet-based, or fragmented**
- No real-time progress tracking per topic
- No faculty-centric dashboard

This solution:
- Centralizes all teaching data in one place
- Tracks syllabus completion live
- Provides day-wise scheduling and insights
- Uses secure Google authentication

---

## 🛠 How does it solve the problem?
- Faculty log in using Google Sign-In
- Teaching sections are stored centrally in Firestore
- Syllabus topics can be marked completed in real time
- Progress percentage is auto-calculated
- Day-wise filtering improves planning and visibility

---

## ✨ Features
